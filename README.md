## WeatherSPA
This app displays the weather forecast for any city. It was created to practice my AngularJS 1.x skills and also use a weather API.

## Instructions
1. Start a local server on your machine ex. `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
2. Navigate to the index.htm file on your local server to use the app.
